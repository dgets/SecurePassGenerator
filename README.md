# SecurePassGenerator
Another random password generator to keep THEM at bay with the dictionary attacks

This is just a little project I've undertaken due to the fact that using PowerShell to generate a secure password under 'doze 10 is a pain in the ass, for a non-technical user.  When you add to that the fact that you're _really playing with fire any time that you decide to start installing freeware apps on a 'doze system_, I figured I'd write my own application, in order to help some friends & family out with secure password generation issues.  If nothing else, they'll be able to use a GUI to do it now, and not have to worry about being totally infiltrated by malware in the meantime.
